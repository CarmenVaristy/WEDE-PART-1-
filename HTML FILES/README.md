PART ONE -

1. Introduction
This proposal outlines the design and development of a fully responsive five-page website for Ocean Breeze Spa, a wellness and 
beauty business in Durban. The website will serve as a modern digital platform to increase brand visibility, improve client interaction, 
and communicate services in a clear, professional way. It will be built using HTML and CSS, with a user-focused layout that reflects 
the calming essence of the spa.

Website Project Proposal for Ocean Breeze Spa
1. Organization Overview
Ocean Breeze Spa is a locally owned wellness and beauty business situated in the heart of Durban. Founded in 2023 by a certified 
skincare and massage therapist with over 10 years of industry experience, the spa was created out of a passion for natural healing, 
self-care, and holistic well-being. It offers clients a peaceful escape from the stress of everyday life through a calming and luxurious 
environment.
The spa provides a comprehensive range of services tailored to support both relaxation and physical wellness. These include fullbody massages (Swedish, deep tissue, hot stone), customized facials, aromatherapy treatments, body scrubs and wraps, waxing, 
and skin-specific therapies. All treatments are delivered by professionally trained therapists using high-quality, eco-conscious 
products suitable for all skin types.
The core mission of Ocean Breeze Spa is to help individuals restore balance, reduce stress, and prioritize their well-being. The 
business promotes the idea that wellness is not a luxury but a necessity, especially in today’s fast-paced world. Through consistent, 
personalized care, the spa strives to build lasting relationships with clients while creating a safe, welcoming space to relax, heal, and 
recharge.
Currently, the spa relies on walk-ins, referrals, and basic social media marketing. However, it lacks a dedicated online platform — a 
gap that significantly limits its reach and visibility in the digital age. To remain competitive and accessible, a professional website is 
essential.

With a custom-built website, Ocean Breeze Spa would benefit in the following ways:
• Showcase its full list of services, prices, and treatment packages in one central, user-friendly location
• Offer an online enquiry form for appointment requests and questions
• Increase search engine visibility and attract new local clients
• Build brand credibility through testimonials, imagery, and a polished digital presence
• Provide 24/7 access to information for both returning and potential customers
Ultimately, the website will serve as a powerful tool to promote growth, improve customer engagement, and align the spa’s calming, 
client-first philosophy with the convenience of modern digital interaction.

2.Website Goals and Objectives
The primary goals for the Ocean Breeze Spa website are to:
• Increase online visibility and attract new local clients.
• Showcase all services, pricing, and treatment packages clearly.
• Provide an easy-to-use online enquiry form for appointment requests and questions.
• Enhance brand credibility through testimonials, high-quality imagery, and professional design.
• Offer 24/7 access to essential information for existing and prospective clients.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
• Number of monthly website visits (target: 500+ within first 6 months).
• Number of online enquiries and appointment requests (target: 30+ per month).
• Bounce rate below 40%.
• Positive client feedback via website testimonials.

3. Current Website Analysis
Currently, Ocean Breeze Spa operates without a dedicated website, relying mostly on walk-ins, referrals, and social media marketing. 
This limits their reach and accessibility, particularly to younger, digitally connected clients. The absence of a centralized digital 
presence reduces opportunities for client engagement, booking convenience, and brand professionalism.

4. Proposed Website Features and Functionality
• Homepage: Hero image with calming visuals, brief introduction, and clear call-to-action (CTA) for bookings/enquiries.
• About Us: History, mission, vision, and team profiles.
• Services: Detailed descriptions, prices, and packages for all treatments.
• Enquiry Page: Online form for appointment requests and general questions.
• Contact Page: Multiple contact options, embedded Google Maps for two locations, and a contact form.
• Testimonials: Rotating client reviews to build trust.
• Blog (optional future feature): Wellness tips and spa updates.

5. Design and User Experience
• Colour Scheme: Soft blues, sea greens, and warm neutrals to evoke calm and relaxation.
• Typography: Clean, readable sans-serif fonts like Aptos or Open Sans, with clear hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body 
text).
• Layout: Minimalist and spacious with intuitive navigation menus, mobile responsive design, and accessible colour contrasts.
• User Experience: Simple navigation bar, consistent buttons, and fast loading times. Accessibility features will include 
keyboard navigation and alt text for images.
• Low-fidelity wireframes will be developed to visualize the layout and flow.

6. Technical Requirements
• Hosting: Affordable, reliable web hosting such as Bluehost or SiteGround.
• Domain: oceanbreezespa.co.za (subject to availability).
• Languages/Frameworks: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for interactivity. No complex backend needed initially; enquiry form will 
send emails via a service like Formspree or similar.
• CMS: Not required for the initial phase, but scalable for future integration.

central entry point for visitors. From there, users can navigate to About Us for company information, Services/Products to explore offerings, 
or the Enquiry Page to submit questions. The Contact Page is linked from the Enquiry section to provide direct communication options. This 
sitemap ensures intuitive navigation, allowing users to access all essential pages efficiently and reflects a user-centered design approach.


3.1 Content Research and Sourcing
In order to build the Ocean Breeze Spa website, all content was carefully researched and sourced to ensure relevance, originality, 
and compliance with licensing requirements. The process included the following:
Organization Information
• Since Ocean Breeze Spa does not yet have a website, the background, mission, services, and values were drafted using 
realistic details inspired by industry standards for small wellness businesses. Information was adapted from general spa and 
wellness trends to ensure authenticity while maintaining originality.
Images
• High-quality images were sourced from StockCake, Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay, all of which provide images under 
royalty-free or Creative Commons licensing. These images represent spa services (e.g., massages, facials), natural products, 
and wellness settings to reflect the calming and professional brand identity of the spa.
• Each image was properly cited in Harvard style and stored within the project’s /images subfolder with descriptive file names 
(e.g., massage_service.jpg, spa_interior.jpg).

2. Fonts
The website and proposal will use the Aptos font, chosen for its clean, modern, and readable style which fits the spa’s professional 
and welcoming tone.
• Font name: Aptos
• Source: Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aptos)
• License: Free for personal and commercial use
Aptos font offers excellent readability for both headings and body text, enhancing user experience across devices.

3. Color Palette
Below is the custom color palette selected for Ocean Breeze Spa’s website to evoke calmness, natural wellness, and elegance:
Color Name Hex Code Description
Ocean Teal #6AB7A8 Main calming color, representing tranquility and nature.
Soft Beige #F4E3C1 Warm background tone, enhancing relaxation.
Warm Copper #D97E4B Accent color to highlight important elements.
